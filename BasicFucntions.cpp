// simple function program in c++
#include<iostream> // first header file you  should include
using namespace std;//  these two lines you should include later on we will know why
void print_my_name() //see here how we have done
{

    cout<<"My name is Ainnie";
}
int main()  // starting of main function
{


 //ok lets make a simple functon that will print your name
 print_my_name(); //this line will call function named as print _my_name
 return 0; //
}
